This website aims to fulfill the 6th topic of the United Nations' “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs), which is “Clean Water and Sanitation." We focus on purifying dirty water and making it available in different forms, selling various types of water, and providing free water to communities in need.
As the first step, we purify dirty water to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials. Then make different water types with distinct characteristics to meet people's needs. Since we aim to provide safe and affordable water for everyone, we distribute our water for an affordable price in our shop category on the website. Also, we organize charitable work to provide clean water to areas without clean water access.
